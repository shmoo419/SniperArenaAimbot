# Sniper Arena v0.8.9 Aimbot

### Made by shmoo @hackedbyshmoo

I included a copy of the code without comments so those of you who want to view the code without clutter can do so.

This aimbot is for educational purposes only. I purposely left out class implementations for Vector3 and Quaternion. You can write those yourself. There's also implementation for Quaternion::LookRotation online.
I included the dump for reference.

Please watch this time, it will make a part of the code make more sense:
